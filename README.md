# RShiny_Example
This repo is to share my code of R shiny example. (MERA meeting on 9th of March, 2022)

Using R shiny to show scatter plot of MRI measures and AP pollutants.

Since there are around 10 MRI measures and 12 AP pollutants, if we list all of them it would be too much to display in a document. Therefore this app is an illustration of how R shiny can help the researchers quickly get the scatter plots they are interested.
